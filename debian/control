Description: Multi-modal connectome and metadata management and integration
 The Connectome File Format Library (cfflib) is a Python module for
 multi-modal connectome data and metadata management and integration for
 the neuroimaging community. It is based on the Connectome File Format
 XML specification, providing  a Python object model. It contains a set
 of connectome objects, representing a high-level interface to
 multi-modal data files stored in various neuroimaging data formats.
 Furthermore, metadata annotation as tags and in structured form is
 possible.
 .
 The following core connectome objects are defined: CMetadata, CNetwork,
 CSurface, CVolume, CSTrack, CTimeseries, CData, CScript.
