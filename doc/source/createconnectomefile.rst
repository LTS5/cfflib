==========================
Create new Connectome File
==========================

First you need to import the library::
    import cfflib

Your first command will be::
    myConnectome = cfflib.connectome()
in order to have a connectome object.

You can check what's inside this object::
    myConnectome.get_all()
this function return all connectome's objects mixed, for now the output is empty.
